# React with TypeScript

## Getting Started

this repository contains some of the codes that I wrote while learning how to use TypeScript with the famous Javascript library which is `React`

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output. It offers classes, modules, and interfaces to help you build robust components. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java. TypeScript can be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution.

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is the view layer for web applications. React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
